It's great that you have your project organized and a clear database schema. To start building your monitoring application, consider focusing on the core functionality and gradually expanding from there. Here's a suggested order for building the various components:

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Begin by implementing the database setup in Python using the `sqlite3` library. Create the tables defined in your schema and ensure that you can perform basic database operations like inserting and querying data.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Develop the data collection component. This includes using libraries like `psutil` and `WMI` to gather information such as hostname, IP address, MAC address, uptime, and hard drive details from the target computers. Test and verify that data collection is working correctly.

3. **WebSocket Server**:
   - Build the WebSocket server using the `websockets` library. This server will handle real-time communication with clients, allowing them to receive updates as soon as the data is collected.

4. **Alerting System**:
   - Implement the alerting system that will notify you in real-time when a target machine goes offline or encounters issues. Ensure that alerts are generated and sent appropriately.

5. **User Interface (Optional)**:
   - If you plan to create a web interface using Flask, start working on it at this stage. Design a simple interface to display the collected data and real-time alerts.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the individual components of your application rigorously to ensure that they work as expected. Check for any bugs or issues.

7. **Integration**:
   - Integrate all the components, such as data collection, WebSocket communication, and the alerting system, to work together seamlessly.

8. **Refinement and Optimization**:
   - Optimize your code, enhance error handling, and make any necessary improvements to ensure the application is stable and efficient.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy your application on a web server or cloud platform if you plan to make it accessible remotely.

10. **Documentation and User Training**:
    - Create documentation that explains how to use and maintain your application. If needed, provide training to users or administrators.

Start by building the foundation of your application, which includes the database, data collection, and communication. As you complete each step, test thoroughly to ensure everything is working correctly. Building in this incremental way will help you identify and address issues early in the development process.
